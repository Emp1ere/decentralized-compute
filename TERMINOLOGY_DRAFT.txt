Draft terminology (not fixed standard yet)
=========================================

This file is a working draft for discussion.
Terms may be renamed later.

1) Orchestrator Node
- Server-side node that exposes API, issues jobs, validates results, and syncs chain state with peer nodes.
- In code context: NODE_ID, NODE_SECRET, PEER_URL, receive_block/receive_chain endpoints.

2) Compute Worker (human role)
- A registered account that performs computations and receives rewards.
- Key identity: client_id.

3) Desktop Agent (software)
- Client application running on user hardware.
- Acts on behalf of a Compute Worker: fetches tasks, computes, submits, sends heartbeats.

4) Device
- Concrete machine running Desktop Agent.
- Key identity: device_id.
- Provides capabilities (cpu_cores, ram_gb, has_gpu, supported_engines) for scheduling.

5) Sector
- Project container owned by a provider account.
- Holds contracts in one compute domain.

6) Contract
- Work definition with budget, reward policy, computation type, and validation requirements.

7) Job / Assignment
- One issued unit of work (chunk) for a worker.
- Key identity: job_id.
- Lifecycle: issued -> in_progress/completed_submitted -> reward_settled/rejected/expired/reassigned.

8) Explorer
- Read-only detailed interface for chain blocks, address/transaction search and audit.

9) Chain summary (dashboard tab)
- Lightweight high-level chain status in web dashboard; deep details should be in Explorer.

Notes for future review
-----------------------
- Decide final naming for "Compute Worker" vs "Calculator" in UI labels.
- Decide whether to keep "Node" exclusively for orchestrator-side entities.
